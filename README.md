# Simple-Music-Player
I recently created a simple music player using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. 
The player features basic controls like play, pause, and stop, offering a straightforward interface that is both clean and functional.
HTML provides the structure, while CSS ensures a visually appealing layout with responsive design.
JavaScript enables interactive features, such as controlling the audio playback and updating the UI dynamically. 
This project allowed me to explore web development basics and improve my skills in front-end technologies while creating a practical and enjoyable user experience.
